# Yukon-harvest-diverity
Code to chanracterize CDN-origin Yukon Chinook populaiton diveristy and run closed-loop simulations of Yukon "like" system to evaluate the performance of alternative management procedures in the face of uncertainty in drivers of recruitment:

>Canadian Yukon Chinook population diversity and its consequences for fisheries management. In preparation. Connors B.M., Siegle M., Harding J., Rossi S., Staton B., Jones M., Bradford M., Browne R., Bechtol B., Doherty B., Cox S., and T. Beacham..

Posterior samples required to parameterize the closed loop simulations are available upon request from brendan.connors@dfo-mpo.gc.ca 

Project made possible by grant 1503 from the [Arctic-Yukon-Kuskokwim Sustainable Salmon Initiative](https://www.aykssi.org/)
